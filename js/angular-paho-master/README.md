# angular-paho
simple angularjs wrapper for paho mqtt client

This is a very simple wrapper for paho - just wrap the client functions and allow a user to initialize a single connection to a server.  
The factory object can then be passed around to other controllers in order to send/recieve messages to/from a broker.

## Quick start
* Check the test.js file for an example
